  <h2>OFF by Mortis Ghost, for Mac and Windows</h2>
  <p>OFF is a French roleplaying game by Mortis Ghost that has been translated to English. More info can be found in the forum thread for the translated game <a href="http://forum.starmen.net/forum/Fan/Games/OFF-by-Mortis-Ghost">here</a>. Details on version 3 of the translation can be found <a href="https://ridiculous-dilettante.tumblr.com/post/171903659089">here</a>.</p>
  <p>In "OFF" you take control of a mysterious person called "The Batter", who is described to be on an important mission. The Batter, and yourself as his controller, are dropped off in zone 0, the first of 4 zones in a perplexing, unknown world about which
    you slowly find out more and more in the process of the game.</p>
  <h3><strong>Downloads</strong></h3>
  <p><strong>Windows</strong>: v3.0 (99MB ZIP) <a href="https://github.com/reidell/off-mac/releases/download/3.0.1/OFF.English.3.0.zip">DOWNLOAD</a></p>
  <p><strong>Mac OS</strong>:<!-- v3.1.0 updated 7/30/2020 (340MB ZIP) --> It's gone.</p> <!--
  <p style="color:red;"><strong>WHOOPS!!! Developing and distributing mac apps has changed a lot in the years since I first released the port. I'm just finding out that apple's policies regarding distributing apps has changed massively, so I've got a whole lot of extra work to do. This might take some time.</strong></p> -->
  <p><strong>NOTE, RE: Mac Port</strong>: The software I've been using is unbelievably broken on Catalina. I just can't distribute an app for any version past 10.13 (which came out in 2016). This is beyond my level of expertise.</p>  
  <!--I've updated the Mac port for 10.15 Catalina. It seems to be running well on my end, but I can't make any guarantees that it'll work for everyone. Give it a shot, though!</p>
  <p>If it works for you, tell me! <a href="https://twitter.com/zchrr">@zchrr</a> on twitter or email <a href="mailto:zach@fastmail.jp">zach@fastmail.jp</a>. Unfortunately I can't provide any support, though. I'm not terribly familiar with Mac development.</p> -->
  <h3><strong>Windows Instructions</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Right click OFF English 3.0.zip, click "Extract All...", navigate to the folder called "OFF English 3.0".</li>
    <li>Open the file titled "RPG_RT.exe" (you might not see the .exe part. it has a little sword for an icon).</li>
  </ol>
  <!-- 
  <ol>
    <li>Right click off_translation_v2.0, click "Extract All...", navigate to the folder called "OFF Translation v. 2.0", which should contain some font files.</li>
    <li>Select all the font files (named Profont, RM(number), etc.), right click them and click "Install". If you don't see the install option, copy the font files into C:\Windows\Fonts\.</li>
    <li>Go into the "NEW OFF TRANSLATION v 2.0" folder and open the file titled "RPG_RT.exe" (you might not see the .exe part. it has a little sword for an icon).</li>
  </ol> -->
  <p>This is the game, don't move the file outside of the folder or it won't run. If you need to move the game elsewhere, move the entire folder named "OFF English 3.0.zip".</p>
  <h3><strong>Mac OS Instructions</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Double click OFF_Mac_v3.1.0.zip. (If this does nothing or you get some sort of an error message, right click and select "Open with" &gt; "Archive Utility". If it's still not working, check that the file is around 356 MB by Apple's estimation, if it's not, try downloading
      it again.)</li>
    <li>Press and hold the control key, then click the OFF icon. Click open when it pops up.</li>
    <li>If the game still refuses to open, check System Preferences, click the Security and Privacy button, and click "Open Anyway" under General.</ol>
  <p>This application will contain your saves, try not to lose it.</p>

  <h3><strong>FAQ</strong></h3>
  <p>Everything that was here was pretty outdated. It works now, probably.</p>
  <!-- <ul>
    <li><strong>The game opens, but does nothing and closes.</strong> Try downloading <a href="http://xquartz.macosforge.org/">XQuartz</a>, rebooting, and trying again.</li>
    <li><strong>The game is asking me to install some fonts.</strong>If you can read the text in the game, you can safely ignore this warning intended for Windows users, the fonts are already installed with the game on Mac.</li>
    <li><strong>I got to zone three then something happened and now I'm walking really slow!!!</strong> When you are on the trolley with Zacharie, talk to him from the front, never the side. If you talked to him from the side, you will start to move slowly
      and the workaround is really complicated and requires Windows.</li>
  </ul>
  <h3><strong>Instructions for transferring saves on Mac OS.</strong></h3>
  <ol>
    <li>right click the previous version of off you used and select "show package contents"</li>
    <li>navigate to drive_c &gt; Program Files &gt; OFF and copy the files titled Save(number).lsd to the new version, in the same directory</li>
  </ol> -->
